- Overall interest in various technologies and constantly trying to learn about new technologies.
- The difficult part is understanding ðŸ§  concepts/structures, but once down, then work can begin.
- ðŸŽ¯ Looking to always be as developer friendly as possible, and utilize good practices as much as possibe.
- Learning about new things, understanding how it can be used.

- Cannot work on coding as much as I'd like to, due to part time work and overall pressure from life.
